# MovieDB Development Log

## Project Overview
Building a MovieDB React TypeScript application for searching movies, viewing details, managing favorites, and editing movie information.

## Change Log

### Step 1: React Router Setup ✅
**Date**: Initial setup
**What Changed**: Configured React Router in App.tsx
**Why**: The application had route components but no routing system to navigate between pages
**Details**:
- Added BrowserRouter wrapper around the entire app
- Imported and configured Routes with 4 paths:
  - `/` → Home (movie grid)
  - `/detail/:id` → Movie detail view
  - `/edit/:id` → Edit movie form  
  - `/favorites` → Favorites page
- Imported all route components (Home, Detail, Edit, Favorites)

### Step 2: Sidebar Navigation ✅
**Date**: Completed
**What Changed**: Added navigation links to the empty sidebar
**Why**: Users need a way to navigate between different sections of the app
**Details**:
- Added navigation links for Home and Favorites pages
- Used React Router's Link components for proper SPA navigation
- Added SVG icons (grid for Home, heart for Favorites)
- Styled with Tailwind classes with hover effects matching existing design
- Imported Link from react-router-dom

**User Modifications**: User simplified the navigation styling by removing SVG icons and updating the background colors (bg-gray-50, hover:bg-gray-100) for better visual consistency.

### Step 3 & 4: Search Functionality + Movie API Integration ✅
**Date**: Completed
**What Changed**: Added complete search functionality with OMDB API integration
**Why**: The search input needs to actually search for movies and display results
**Details**:
- **Search Component**: Added useState for search term, form submission handling, and onSearch prop interface
- **App Component**: Added searchMovies async function that calls OMDB API with error handling and loading states
- **API Integration**: Configured OMDB API calls (requires API key: http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx)
- **Home Component**: Updated to accept movies, loading, and error props with conditional rendering for different states
- **MovieCard Component**: Updated to accept movie prop and display real movie data (title, year, poster)
- **Navigation**: Added "View Details" link to each movie card pointing to detail page
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback for API failures
- **API Key**: Configured with user's OMDB API key (1a993ee0) - search functionality is now fully operational

### Step 5: Movie Detail Page Implementation ✅
**Date**: Completed
**What Changed**: Implemented full movie detail fetching and display
**Why**: Detail page was showing static placeholders instead of real movie information
**Details**:
- **API Integration**: Added detail API call using `i` parameter: `http://www.omdbapi.com/?apikey=1a993ee0&i={{imdbID}}`
- **URL Parameters**: Using useParams to extract imdbID from route `/detail/:id`
- **State Management**: Added loading, error, and movie data states with useEffect for data fetching
- **Rich Display**: Shows comprehensive movie info (Title, Year, Actors, Director, Genre, Runtime, IMDB Rating, Plot)
- **Navigation**: Added "Back to Search" and "Edit Movie" links
- **Error Handling**: Proper error states and fallback for missing movie data
- **Toggle Integration**: Passed movieId prop to Toggle component for favorites functionality

### Step 6: Inline Edit Functionality ✅
**Date**: Completed
**What Changed**: Implemented inline editing on the detail page instead of separate edit route
**Why**: Better UX - users can edit movie information directly on the detail page without navigation
**Details**:
- **Edit Mode State**: Added isEditing and editedMovie state for toggling between view/edit modes
- **Inline Form Fields**: Conditionally render input fields vs. display text based on edit mode
- **Save/Cancel Logic**: Added handleSave, handleCancel, and handleInputChange functions
- **Form Validation**: Input fields maintain proper styling and type handling
- **Preserved Data**: IMDB Rating remains read-only, other fields become editable
- **UI Polish**: Edit/Save/Cancel buttons with proper styling and hover effects
- **Data Persistence**: Changes saved to local state (ready for localStorage or API integration)

### Step 7: Favorites Functionality ✅
**Date**: Completed
**What Changed**: Implemented complete favorites system with localStorage persistence
**Why**: Users need to save movies they like and access them later
**Details**:
- **Global State**: Added favorites state management in App.tsx with localStorage persistence
- **Favorites Context**: Created FavoritesContextType interface for add/remove/check functions
- **Toggle Functionality**: Updated Toggle component to work with real favorites state
- **Visual Feedback**: Toggle shows red when favorited, gray when not, with smooth animations
- **Favorites Counter**: Navigation shows live count of saved favorites (e.g., "Favorites (3)")
- **Favorites Page**: Displays saved movies in grid layout with empty state message
- **Data Persistence**: Favorites automatically save/load from localStorage across sessions
- **Edit Integration**: When editing favorited movies, changes update in favorites list too
- **Smart Props**: Passed favorites context to Detail route and movie data to Favorites route

### Step 8: Quick Remove from Favorites ✅
**Date**: Completed  
**What Changed**: Added ability to remove movies directly from favorites page
**Why**: Better UX - users shouldn't have to go into movie details just to remove from favorites
**Details**:
- **MovieCard Enhancement**: Added optional onRemove prop and conditional remove button (red × in top-right corner)
- **Favorites Integration**: Pass removeFromFavorites function to MovieCard components on favorites page
- **Event Handling**: Remove button prevents event bubbling and navigation conflicts
- **Visual Design**: Red circular remove button with hover effects, positioned absolute in card corner
- **User Experience**: Click × to instantly remove movie from favorites without page navigation

**User Feedback Integration**: Updated to show Edit and Delete buttons side by side on favorites page instead of View Details, since favorite movies are stored in global storage and can be modified. This provides clearer action buttons for managing favorites.

### Step 9: Search Redirect to Home ✅
**Date**: Completed
**What Changed**: Added automatic redirect to Home page when searching from any page
**Why**: Since search bar is visible on all pages, users should be redirected to Home to see search results
**Details**:
- **Navigation Integration**: Added useNavigate hook from React Router
- **Component Restructure**: Created AppContent component to access useNavigate inside BrowserRouter
- **Search Redirect**: Added navigate('/') call in searchMovies function before API call
- **Seamless UX**: Users can search from Favorites, Detail, or any page and automatically see results on Home
- **Preserved Functionality**: All existing search functionality remains intact, just adds navigation

### Step 10: Toggle Component Refactor with clsx ✅
**Date**: Completed
**What Changed**: Refactored Toggle component to use clsx package for conditional classes
**Why**: Better maintainability and cleaner conditional class logic as specified in requirements
**Details**:
- **clsx Integration**: Imported and used clsx package for conditional class management
- **Button Classes**: Applied exact default classes with conditional BG-GREEN-600/BG-GRAY-200
- **Span Classes**: Applied exact default classes with conditional TRANSLATE-X-5/TRANSLATE-X-0  
- **Cleaner Code**: Replaced template literals with clsx conditional objects
- **Maintained Functionality**: All toggle behavior remains exactly the same, just cleaner implementation
